# âš¡ Realtime Chat App with AWS AppSync, DynamoDB & GraphQL

A fully serverless, production-grade **real-time chat application** that leverages **AWS AppSync**, **GraphQL subscriptions**, and **DynamoDB** to deliver low-latency two-way messaging with live updates via WebSockets. Built from scratch with custom schema design, resolver mapping, and frontend WebSocket integration â€” all deployed via Serverless Framework.

## ðŸ§  What This Project Demonstrates

This project reflects **hands-on experience in cloud-native, real-time architecture** and full-stack serverless development:

- âœ… Designing and deploying a real-time **GraphQL API** using AWS AppSync.
- âœ… Building scalable backend logic with **DynamoDB resolvers** and custom VTL templates.
- âœ… Setting up a **live frontend subscription** over WebSocket that listens for messages directed to specific users.
- âœ… Using `webpack-dev-server` and Babel for cross-browser compatible development.
- âœ… Handling edge cases like invalid resolvers, identity injection, and subscription filtering.

## ðŸ§© How It Works


1. **Mutation:** A user sends a message via `message(to, body)`.
2. **Resolver:** The message is stored in DynamoDB with a unique ID and timestamp.
3. **Subscription:** The recipient listens via `subscription inbox(to)` and receives the message live in-browser.
